# Important tips
Making a package:
* mkdir ros_package && cd ros_package
* gedit .bashrc
* in bashrc file: (comment out after) 'export ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=~/ros_package:$ROS_PACKAGE_PATH'
* roscreate-pkg wander rospy std_msgs
* in this directory you will put your launch file and python file
<br/>
never use this link: (it permanently changes your bashrc file)
